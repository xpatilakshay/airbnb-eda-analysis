# Airbnb EDA Project

## 📋 Project Description
This project is part of a **Data Analyst Internship Task ** focused on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**.  
The objective is to extract insights, find patterns, and perform visual exploration of an Airbnb dataset using Python.

## 📚 Dataset Used
Dataset: [Airbnb Dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yW_ozXy8T5FriB0jtAWiYCO7McA70WOC/view?usp=sharing)

## 🛠 Libraries and Tools
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **NumPy** for numerical operations
- **Matplotlib** for data visualization

## 🔎 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Steps
- Loaded the dataset and checked basic information (`.head()`, `.info()`, `.describe()`).
- Analyzed missing values and basic distributions.
- Created visualizations such as:
  - Scatterplots
  - Bar plots
- Observed trends and extracted basic insights from the dataset.

## 📈 Key Observations
- The dataset contains various types of property listings.
- Certain areas have a higher number of Airbnb listings.
- Prices vary significantly across locations and property types.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`Air bnd.ipynb`) in a local environment (e.g., JupyterLab, VSCode, Google Colab).
3. Run the cells sequentially to view the EDA process and outputs.
